## Install OPNsense
The first step you need to do is install OPNsense on your desired hardware. I am using a EVE-NG to host my firewall
Go to the OPNsense download page. Choose the “iso” installer so you can install it on a USB drive. Use a program such as Etcher to flash the drive with the image you just downloaded (you do not even have to extract the image if you are using Etcher).
